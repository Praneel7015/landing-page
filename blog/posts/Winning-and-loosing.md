You might recall that I placed 6th in the last AWS Builder Challenge, where the goal was to build a landing page/homepage/website in the cloud using AWS services. The top 5 received keyboards, and it was an open secret that many of them had 'botted' their articles, fair enough.

This time, it was round two, with the third Builder Challenge, the [Rift Rewind Hackathon on AWS Builder Center](https://builder.aws.com/content/32Z4SrTB8V1g0mMUGmyMUWXVgsu/rift-rewind-hackathon-on-aws-builder-center). The theme was Riot Games' League of Legends, requiring the use of Riot's League API to find player stats. (I don't play PvP, FPS, or League-esque games, so this was a bit outside my usual.) It essentially involved making a website, (my gaming-themed, Riot-inspired website, check it out!at [gaming.praneel.tech](https://gaming.praneel.tech/).  You can also find [my article here](https://builder.aws.com/content/33dIbS80WEsaRfdAaPqqKmAlCeZ/rift-rewind-challenge-1-building-a-website)).

I honestly didn't think much of it and didn't share it with anyone. To my surprise, I actually won! The [winners were announced here](https://builder.aws.com/content/33smDWCpijIlOU7qaW6IKYn6AYo/rift-rewind-challenge-1-winners-announced). I'm glad they rectified their previous mistakes of making it solely engagement-based, ensuring that those who genuinely share their work get the recognition, not botters.

On the losing side, I broke my laptop. The one thing I cared about most is now dead. While trying to change an SSD, I forgot to unplug the battery, which sadly fried my motherboard. So now I am laptop-less and times are grim. Even though I won, it truly feels like I've lost. **MAKE SURE TO PLUG OUT YOUR BATTERY PEOPLE.**

And well, that's about it for now. I will also share pictures of the mechanical keyboard I won in the next blog, probably!

Thanks for Reading!
