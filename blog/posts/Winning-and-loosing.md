You might recall that I placed 6th in the last AWS Builder Challenge, where the goal was to build a landing page/homepage/website in the cloud using AWS services. The top 5 received keyboards, and it was an open secret that many of them had 'botted' their articles. Fair enough.

This time, it was round two, with the third Builder Challenge. The theme was Riot Games' League of Legends, requiring the use of Riot's League API to find player stats. (I don't play PvP, FPS, or League-esque games, so this was a bit outside my usual.) It essentially involved remaking a website, [gaming.praneel.tech](https://gaming.praneel.tech/). I honestly didn't think much of it and didn't share it with anyone. To my surprise, I actually won! I'm glad they rectified their previous mistakes of making it solely engagement-based, ensuring that those who genuinely share their work get the recognition, not botters.

On the losing side, I broke my laptop. The one thing I cared about most is now dead. I'm trying to get it fixed, and when I do, I'll probably post an update.

And well, that's about it for now.

Thanks for Reading!
